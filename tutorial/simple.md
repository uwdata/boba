# Getting started

In this tutorial, we will walk you through a simple analysis scenario to
demonstrate how you might write and execute multiverse using our tool.

### A simple analysis script

Let's say we have the following analysis script that reads a data file, removes
 outliers, and fits a linear model.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # read data file
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    
    # remove outliers
    # discard rows outside 2 x std
    df = df[np.abs(df.y - df.y.mean()) <= (2 * df.y.std())]
    
    # fit a simple ordinary least squares model
    x = sm.add_constant(df.x)
    lm = sm.OLS(df.y, x).fit()
```

### Placeholder variable

Suppose the threshold for removing outliers is pretty subjective; you can
justify removing data points outside 2, 2.5 or 3 standard deviations of the
mean. Would the prediction change if you adopt a different threshold? To test
this, you might insert a decision point and ask the tool to output a
separate script for each possible threshold configuration. To insert a decision,
first insert a placeholder variable `{{var_name}}` in the above code:

```python
df = df[np.abs(df.y - df.y.mean()) <= ({{cutoff}} * df.y.std())]
```

Then, in a separate JSON file, you could list the possible options this
placeholder variable can take up:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {"var": "cutoff", "options": [2, 2.5, 3] }
  ]
}
```

Now, calling the tool with the file path to your script and JSON will output 3
python scripts. Each script is a universe where you choose a different cutoff
value for removing outliers; for example, one of the universes is exactly the
same as the analysis script we started with. The tool also outputs a summary
table to let you know what parameter value is taken up by which file:

|Filename     |Code Path|cutoff|
|-------------|---------|------|
|universe_1.py|_start   |2     |
|universe_2.py|_start   |2.5   |
|universe_3.py|_start   |3     |

(The table contains an unfamiliar column "Code Path", which we will explain in
a minute!)

If you specify multiple decisions, we will output **all combinations** of
possible alternatives. Namely, the number of output scripts will be the
cross-product of the number of options for each decision.

### Code blocks

Your decision point can be more complex than replacing values of a variable.
For example, instead of removing data points outside some standard deviations
of the mean, it is also reasonable to remove data points outside some IQRs of
the median. 

```python
iqr = np.subtract(*np.percentile(df.y, [75, 25]))
median = np.median(df.y)
df = df[abs(df.y - median) <= 3 * iqr]
```
As you can see, this alternative requires a few lines to implement; it is no
longer a straightforward value substitution. You can of course write the entire
block of code as a string into the options array, but it will be really
cumbersome.

You might instead consider using code blocks. Instead of a
linear flow from start to end, your code can consist of blocks, similar to
cells in Jupyter notebook or R markdown. To specify a code block, simply insert
a comment line with the syntax `# --- (ID) option` immediately
before the starting line of the block. The lines of code between this
declaration and the next (or the end of file) is a block
named `ID`. We will go ahead and insert three such comments into
our script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # read data file
    df = pd.read_csv('../data.csv')

    # --- (A) std
    # remove outliers based on std
    df = df[np.abs(df.y - df.y.mean()) <= ({{cutoff}} * df.y.std())]

    # --- (A) iqr
    # remove outliers based on iqr
    iqr = np.subtract(*np.percentile(df.y, [75, 25]))
    median = np.median(df.y)
    df = df[abs(df.y - median) <= 3 * iqr]

    # --- (B)
    # fit a simple ordinary least squares model
    x = sm.add_constant(df.x)
    lm = sm.OLS(df.y, x).fit()

    # display results
    print('y = {:.2f} + {:.2f} * x'.format(lm.params.const, lm.params.x))
    print('AIC: {:.2f}'.format(lm.aic))
    print('Coehn\'s F2: {:.3f}'.format(lm.rsquared_adj))
```

These three comments break the code into **four** blocks. All lines before
`# --- (A) std` belong to the first, unnamed block. All lines between `# --- (A) std`
and `# --- (A) iqr` belong to block "A" with option "std". All lines between
`# --- (B)` and the end of the file belong to block "B".

Note that we have two types of blocks: some blocks, such as `(A) std` and
`(A) iqr`, specify an *option* after the parenthesis.
Such blocks are called *decision blocks*; the same ID can take up different
options, not unlike a placeholder variable. Other blocks, such as `(B)`, are
normal blocks that do not act like a decision point.

We now need to tell boba the relationship between the blocks. 
We want to remove outliers before fitting the model, so the order of the blocks
should be A followed by B. Note that while A has two options `std` and `iqr`,
we only use `A` in the graph and boba will choose different options in
different universes. Let's specify the relationship of the blocks as a directed
graph in the JSON file:

```json
{
  "graph": ["A->B"],
  "decisions": [
    {"var": "cutoff", "options": [2, 2.5, 3] }
  ]
}
```
The graph is optional, with the default being a linear path of all the blocks
according to their order in the template script. In this example, we could
omit the graph and still get the same result.

Now, calling the program with our updated script and JSON will generate 4
universes where the following value and code path is chosen:

|Filename     |Code Path   |cutoff|(A)|
|-------------|------------|------|---|
|universe_1.py|_start->A->B|2     |std|
|universe_2.py|_start->A->B|2.5   |std|
|universe_3.py|_start->A->B|3     |std|
|universe_4.py|_start->A->B|      |iqr|

Since we did not use the parameter `cutoff` in our outlier removal code
involving IQR, our multiverse does not expand the parameter `cutoff` when
block `A` takes the option `iqr`. If we change the code in IQR to be:

```python
df = df[abs(df.y - median) <= {{cutoff}} * iqr]
```

We will get 6 universes:

|Filename     |Code Path   |cutoff|(A)|
|-------------|------------|------|---|
|universe_1.py|_start->A->B|2     |iqr|
|universe_2.py|_start->A->B|2.5   |iqr|
|universe_3.py|_start->A->B|3     |iqr|
|universe_4.py|_start->A->B|2     |std|
|universe_5.py|_start->A->B|2.5   |std|
|universe_6.py|_start->A->B|3     |std|

Take a look at the generated python scripts
[here](https://github.com/uwdata/boba/tree/master/example/simple/output/code).

(You may notice that all code paths in the above table are the same. In a more
complex analysis, we might produce differing code paths, by creating
branches in the directed graph. We will cover
advanced usage of the graph in a later tutorial.)

### Executing the multiverse
After you are happy with the generated scripts, you might want to execute them
all to compute the results. Boba has a command for executing universes:

```bash
boba run --all
```
It will run **all** the scripts for you! Before you do this, you might want
to run one script, or simply look at a few scripts, to ensure that
the generated code does not have syntax errors, etc. To run a selected range
of universes, for example universe number 1 through 3, do:

```bash
boba run 1 --thru 3
```

### Try it yourself!

The code and data of this example is available [here](https://github.com/uwdata/boba/tree/master/example/simple).
To run the example, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd example/simple
